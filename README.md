# 📦 BitTorrent Client in JavaScript

A custom-built BitTorrent client written in JavaScript, implementing the BitTorrent protocol from scratch. This project is part of a hands-on learning initiative to understand how torrenting works at the protocol level.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Parse `.torrent` files (BEncoding decoding)
- ✅ Connect to HTTP/UDP trackers
- ✅ Peer discovery and handshake
- ✅ Peer wire protocol (request, piece, choke, unchoke)
- ✅ Piece downloading and assembly
- ❌ No GUI – CLI-based learning project

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/bittorrent-javascript.git
cd bittorrent-javascript
npm install
Run the Client
